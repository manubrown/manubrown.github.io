		<p> <!--breaks paragraphs-->
		My full name is Manutuufanga Masele Brown, but I go by Manu for short. The meaning of my name is <em> <!--indicates that text inside should be emphasized--> "shot down bird"</em>. I am from East Palo Alto, CA. where I was raised all 15 years of my life. I will be a Junior in the fall of 2019, at a school named Oxford Day Academy. The school I attend is not your traditional American highschool the model of our school has been adapted from Oxford University's model. So most of our learning is based on critical thinking . I currently live with both of my parents, five sisters and little brother. I identify as a Polynesian because my grandparents are from Samoa and Tonga.
